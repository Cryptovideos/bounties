## Logo Design update. 
Summary of member driven iniative to reinvent the RChain Cooperative logo. 

Github issue - [Issue #148](https://github.com/rchain/Members/issues/148)

Public Discord - [#logo-design](https://discord.gg/fvY8qhx)

Drivers - @ValeBF, @llerner, @patrick727

Summary:

[Final Design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PgWzDl0VBc1I_hGT5VQNIkqtmmiNElJs/view)

[Runner-Up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HH5ClD_t7fGAaQ2LO-I52SDclS_hABJk/view)

After weeks of collaboration on the github issue, the drivers moved for final feedback into #logo-design on the public discord, where many members contributed thoughtfully and multiple varations and iterations where created and shared to the group. 

2018-01-08: The Drivers for the logo design concluded on a final design(now the "runner up"). Based on the points below. 

-   2 Tone Color Palette (red and black)

-   Hollow center to represent "genesis block"

-   Represents consensus in a distributed network, with the "R" for "RChain" as the connections

-   Works well in shrunken sizes

-   Works well on printouts

After announcing it in #logo-design on the public discord, multiple contributors had a specific request to eliminate the hollow center that represents the genesis block. 

A Board member suggested to create a poll within the #polling-station on the public discord in order to vote on the final two options; the option with the hollow center, and the option without. 

The poll was created and described on that Wednesdays debrief - [video link here](https://youtu.be/Zeh2S1cW_hE?t=21m36s)

2018-01-10: Roughly 40 people voted between the two options and the poll was closed. 


Outstanding Considerations.

-   Only 40 people voted in total, which is considerable for "active" members, but not representative of the total membership(almost 600 at the time of this)

-   The last minute decision to poll was good intentioned, but members expressed that, moving forward, these types of process' should be laid out in advanced, presented with adquetate time in advance for members to know, and followed through the deadline with no exceptions as as to keep things on track. 

-   Integration with [.coop branding](http://www.domains.coop/media/21841/marque_guidelines_en.pdf) is still a consideration when thinking of new layouts.
