Reasoning:

It is the most considerate of the member feedback.

-   2 Tone Color Palette (red and black)

-   Hollow center to represent "genesis block"

-   Represents consensus in a distributed network, with the "R" for "RChain" as the connections

-   Works well in shrunken sizes

-   Works well on printouts

Outstanding Considerations.

-   Integration with [.coop branding](http://www.domains.coop/media/21841/marque_guidelines_en.pdf)
