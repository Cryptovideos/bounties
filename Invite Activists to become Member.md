Dear {{Github Name}},

Thanks for having gone through the PRE-membership procedure. As you know the term Activist was a temporary invention, because the process for becoming a formal member of the Coop was not yet in place.

We now invite you to become a Member of the RChain Cooperative, i.e. moving from Activist to Member. It just needs an extra verification of your identity to establish proof of individuality, because we want to be sure that we're dealing with real persons. Please go through the process of [participating in the Private Sale](https://presale.rchain.coop/#/sign-in). Of course you are free to particpate but don't have to participate in the Private Sale. The reason is that it includes the process of becoming a Member.

{{Remark}}

**Process**

- Get a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) account
- [Sign up](https://presale.rchain.coop/#/sign-up) for the Pre Sale and pay the $20 fee. You will be reimbursed the $20 if you've paid also during the PRE-membership process.
- Set a conference call time slot with a representative of RChain cooperative. During the conference call the representative tries to accomplish **4 Membership requirements**:
- [Affirm Membership agreement](https://github.com/rchain/legaldocs/blob/master/Coop%20Membership%20Agreement.pdf)
- Photo of current govt issued ID
- Verified payment of membership fee
- Verify face on live video

**Promotion to MEMBER**

When the 4 Membership Requirements are completed and recorded, a Discord Moderator promotes the user to ROLE=MEMBER and append a ":" to the member's Discord alias for proof of individuality.

**Member Signup Portal**

This process is not in place yet, but it should make things easier. Navneet and Branko are working to enable the private-sale website for MEMBER signups. The site will collect payment, record users' contact information, ask them to affirm the Membership Agreement, and upload photo ID to a secure location. After payment, users are given a Discord invitation. 

On Discord, users may request a Live Verification from any online user whose name appears in red (Verifier) or green (Moderator ). Verifiers have access to the photo ID storage location, and to a shared spreadsheet where they share and record verification information.

**Pre-Paid via Portal**

Users who have already paid through the private-sale site, but who are not participating in the private-sale, should already have affirmed the membership agreement, received their paid Bitpay invoice# via email, as well as a Discord invitation. They can follow the Live Verification procedure above.

**Pre-Paid Activists**

Activists who have paid $20 to HJ still need to affirm to the [Membership Agreement](https://github.com/rchain/legaldocs/blob/master/Coop%20Membership%20Agreement.pdf), provide their ID, get a Discord Invitation, and request a Live Verification. Each paid activist will be emailed a unique invitation code for Discord. They should reply to this email with a written affirmation of the Member Agreement. They may attach their ID to the email, or provide it during the Live Verification for screen capture by the Verifier to upload to secure storage. On Discord, the user tells the verifier both their email address and unique Discord invite code. The Verifier can now procedeed with the Live Verification procedure above.

**Communication**

[Rchain](https://rchain.coop) has several channels to make easy communication possible within the growing community.
- We work together and keep each other updated through [Github/RChain/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members)
- We've moved from [Slack](https://ourchain.slack.com/messages?) to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/349667445566472202/357561188676009986). Discord has several channels to discuss about all kind of things. The goal is to create actionable issues in [Github/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members/) that are handled by the member-community.
- We're experimenting with [Mattermost](https://rchain.divvydao.net/community/channels/town-square) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/rchain/Rholang) to create insight in who does what when and why.
- The different environments are bridged together. So you would see messages from for example Discord in Mattermost or Gitter.
- We've [Google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rchain) for interaction through email.
- There's a small [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=rchain%20cooperative) presentation and we're also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rchain_coop)
- We're on [BitcoinTalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1747033.0) and a channel on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RChain/)
- There are also weekly conference calls with unedited archives on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSS3jCffMiz574_q64Ukj_w)
- And of course our [website](https://rchain.coop).

**Collaboration**

Through [Github/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members/) issues are created by anyone. It's up to us to handle all those issues in an organized manner, based on self organization and decentralisation. We trust on the skills and common sense to solve the issues and get rewarded in a reasonable way in RHOC.

**Trading**

RHOC is not yet on exchanges like Bittrex or Poloniex. However it has attention through issue [29](https://github.com/rchain/Members/issues/29). In the mean time RHOC is traded in low volumes on:
- [Etherdelta](https://etherdelta.com/#RHOC-ETH) 
- [OasisDex](https://oasisdex.com/#trade/RHOC/W-ETH) 

**Values**

The RChain Activist Members way of working works well when we keep certain values in mind:

- We make decisions. Decisions have to be supported at least three members.
- We are courageous. We are allowed to do the wrong thing, because otherwise, we can never do the right thing either.
- We share profits according to SMART participation in results.
- We advance one another. We depend on our cohesion.
- We trust one another. We know that each and every one of us wants the best for the cooperative.
- We take initiatives and respect those of others.If we see something we dislike, we respond by making and spreading something we like, instead of pointing out what we dislike. We need diversity in our activism and strive for it.
- We respect knowledge. In discussing a subject, any subject, hard measured data is preferable. Second preference goes to a person with experience in the subject.
- We respect the time of others and the focus of the organization.
- We act with dignity. Weâ€™re always showing respect in our shaping of public opinion: respect toward each other, toward newcomers, and toward our adversaries.
- We are long term. 
- The cooperative has to be managed in a way that the members believe in what they think is best for the reaching the mission.
