# Group Butler Bot Rules

    Group Butler is a Telegram bot that enables new users to be informed about the rules of the channel. 
    The bot does many other things useful for administrators. It supports Markdown so we can work out
    the rules of the rchain_coop channel here. 

**RChain Coop Chat Rules**

1. This group focuses on RChain Cooperative technology, activities, and related initiatives.
2. It is not a trading group. Please keep RHOC market pricing discussion to a minimum.
3. A bit of off-topic isn't bad, but within reason.
4. Please don't post referral links. 
5. Shilling other tokens, ICOs, or Pump&Dump actions will get you banned with no warning.
6. DMing group users, trying to scam people, or promoting anything will result in an instaban.
7. Let's keep the conversation civil. We want this to be a constructive chat for collective benefit.

This is an officially sanctioned group but the admins are not official representatives of RChain Cooperative. The admins are community members with their own opinions and interpretations.

Thanks and welcome on board!
